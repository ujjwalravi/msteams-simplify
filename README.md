# simplified-attendance
When you download attendance from Microsoft Teams, it shows complete logs which is sometimes way too much for normal users. It shows details about every 'Joined' and 'Left' events spread across multiple lines.
This tool will help users to convert the original '.csv' file into new simplified '.csv' file. 
New simplified file will include:
1) List sorted according to alphabetical order
2) Shows number of times a particular user has joined
3) Total duration a user has spent across all Join and Left session.
